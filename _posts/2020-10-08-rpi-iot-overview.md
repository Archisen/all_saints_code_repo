## The Plan

This post will act asd an overview of my raspberry pi IoT server. I am basing this project off of Andreas Spiess' youtube channel [video #295][AP video 295]. In future posts I wil actually be going throught the proccess of creating each of the server components. I'll write about what I did in each proccess and include the different pitfalls I encounter. As this is one of my first blog posts on this page it'll be fun to try and develop a wrtiting while developing style. 

## Project  Guide
As stated above this project will be following [video #295][AP video 295] of Andreas Spiess' YouTube channel looking at the using the raspberry pi as an IoT server using Docker, a Mosquito, nodeRed, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
